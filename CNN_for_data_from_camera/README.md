Statistics show that one of the leading cause of road accidents in India is a result of potholes. A survey in 2020 showed that over 5,000 people died in road accidents due to potholes during 2018-2020.

This can easily be changed by the detection of potholes using depth cameras installed on cars, or CCTV cameras installed on roads.
