Statistics show that one of the leading cause of road accidents in India is a result of potholes. A survey in 2020 showed that over 5,000 people died in road accidents due to potholes during 2018-2020.

This can easily be changed by the detection of potholes using depth cameras installed on cars, or CCTV cameras installed on roads. Based on real-time feed and image analysis using the CNN, potholes can be detected and an alert can be sent to the RSU. This data can then be used by the transportation authorities and roads can be fixed 
quickly
