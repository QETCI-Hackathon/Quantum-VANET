The BB84 is a quantum key-distribution protocol that is based on Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle. The protocol is named BB84 after the authors’ names and the year it was published. It is one of the most prominent quantum protocols. 

In the BB84 protocol, Alice can transmit a random secret key to Bob by sending a string of photons with the private key encoded in their polarization. The no-cloning theorem guarantees that Eve cannot measure these photons and transmit them to Bob without disturbing the photon’s state in a detectable way.

The above is true, considering no error on the quantum channel. If the track is prone to error, Alice and Bob will not detect Eve’s presence all the time.
