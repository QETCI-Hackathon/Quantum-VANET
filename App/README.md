A mobile application is developed for non-autonomous vehicles.
This application is linked to the OBU as well as a local RSU.

It provides GPS coordinates and a GMap interface for a user to easily find the best route to get to their destination.
It also provides an interface to alert the driver about obstacles and a list of emergency contacts in case of an accident.
