The present scenario uses classical networking protocols such as DSRC/WAVE.The traversal algorithms are implemented on top of the dedicated short-range 
communication (DSRC) / wireless access in vehicular environments (WAVE) protocol stack, while accounting for channel impairments such as path loss and fading.
In our model, we use protocols such as GPSR for efficient routing of messages between OBU's and RSU's.

As the quantum world and the optimist's view of quantum communications develop, we hope to incorporate the quantum internet into our model. At present, however
this is still a far-fetched and sci-fi like model. Nevertheless, dreamers
